        Positional args of some sort. Basic trigger would be a Flag with no names.
        We need a new attribute for position. Or perhaps ordering is better?
        So if there are 3 Flags and 3 args that don't match the named flags then
        order() would determine which flag goes where.

        user module should be called test. 
        there should be unit tests that run various generated
        main classes and match output. 
        Compilation errors should never be a correct scenario 
        so all tests can assume the main class is generated and compiled ok. 
        But there needs to be tests for wrongly applied params, 
        making sure error feedback makes sense.

        There should be a notion of subcommands, 
        let's say a Flag field has an object type.
        Could we new that class and have following args be applied on that?
